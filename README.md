This repository supports our research paper on "Enhancing Pedestrian Safety in AVs with Multiple Trajectory Prediction and Action Recognition" by Issa Nasralli, Imen Masmoudi, and Hassen Drira.

## Overview

Intent estimation systems are crucial for enhancing pedestrian safety in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). These systems involve the development of classifiers that analyze a sequence of preceding frames to determine pedestrian intent within a given time period. In our paper, we explore the pivotal components within this dynamic field, especially object detection, object tracking, and intent estimation.
